# DDOS-Attack

This project helps us to study the DDOS Botnet attack by IOT devices by applying data science and machine learning models.

The data is highly undistributed.We have to convert every attribute datatype to float datatype so that text attributes can be converted to numerical datatype with the help of label encoder.

Applied correlation and variance concepts and considered only important columns for model predictions

Applied different machine learning algorithms to predict accuracy.
